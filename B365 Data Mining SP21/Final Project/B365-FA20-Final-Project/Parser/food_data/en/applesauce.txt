Apple sauce or applesauce is a sauce made of apples. It can be made with peeled or unpeeled apples and may be spiced or sweetened. Apple sauce is inexpensive and widely consumed in North America and some of Europe.A wide range of apple varieties is used to make apple sauce, depending on the preference for sweetness or tartness. Formerly, sour apples were used to make savory apple sauce.Commercial versions of apple sauce are readily available at retail grocers.


== Preparation ==
	
Apple sauce is made by cooking apples with water or apple cider (fresh apple juice). More acidic apples will render a finer purée; the highly acidic Bramley apple creates a very fine purée. The apples may or may not be peeled. If they are not peeled, the peels and seeds are typically separated in a food mill. Sugar and spices such as cinnamon, allspice, and even Red Hot candies may be added for flavor. Lemon juice, citric acid, or other acidifiers may be used to preserve the color and ensure a high enough acidity for safe storage. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) also preserves the color.
Apple sauce can be made by baking rather than boiling, in which case the apples are peeled and cored before cooking.Home or commercially canned apple sauce is sterilized by heat to preserve freshness.


=== Apple butter ===

Apple butter is a highly concentrated version of apple sauce. Its high concentration of sugar gives it a long shelf life.

== Career ==


=== 2008–2012: Musical beginnings and Nickelodeon ===
By age 13, she became serious about pursuing a music career, although she still concentrated on theater. When she first arrived in Los Angeles, California to meet with her managers, she expressed a desire to record an R&B album: "I was like, 'I want to make an R&B album,' They were like 'Um, that's a helluva goal! Who is going to buy a 14-year-old's R&B album?!'" In 2008, Grande was cast in the supporting role of cheerleader Charlotte in the musical 13 on Broadway. When she joined the musical, Grande left North Broward Preparatory School, but continued to be enrolled; the school sent materials to her so she could study with tutors. She also sang various times at the New York City jazz club Birdland.

Grande was cast in the Nickelodeon television show Victorious along with 13 co-star Elizabeth Gillies in 2009. In the sitcom, set at a performing arts high school, Grande played the "adorably dimwitted" Cat Valentine. She had to dye her hair red every other week for the role—which severely damaged her hair—because the executive producer, Dan Schneider, did not want all the cast members to be brunettes, and the red was a feature that the network felt fitted Cat's personality. The show premiered in March 2010 to the second-largest audience for a live-action series in Nickelodeon, with 5.7 million viewers. The role helped propel Grande to teen idol status, but she was more interested in a music career, stating that acting is "fun, but music has always been first and foremost with me." Her character was compared to "Brittany Murphy's performance as the hapless Tai in Clueless" and described as being "very impressionable and easily swayed" but "generally sweet". She also played the role of Miriam in the musical Cuba Libre, written and produced by American songwriter Desmond Child.After the first season of Victorious wrapped, Grande wanted to focus on her music career and began working on her debut album in August 2010. To strengthen her vocal range, she began working with vocal coach Eric Vetro. The second season premiered in April 2011 to 6.2 million viewers, becoming the highest rated episode of Victorious. In May 2011, she appeared in Greyson Chance's music video for the song "Unfriend You" from his album Hold On 'til the Night (2011), portraying Chance's ex-girlfriend. Grande made her first musical appearance on the track "Give It Up" from the Victorious soundtrack in August 2011. While filming Victorious, Grande made several recordings of herself singing covers of songs by Adele, Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey, and uploaded them to YouTube. A friend of Monte Lipman, chief executive officer (CEO) of Republic Records, came across one of Grande's videos. Impressed by her vocals, he sent the links to Lipman, who signed her to a recording contract. Grande voiced the title role in the English dub of the Spanish-language animated film Snowflake, the White Gorilla in November 2011. From 2011 to 2013, Grande voiced the fairy Princess Diaspro in the Nickelodeon revival of Winx Club.Grande released her first single, "Put Your Hearts Up", in December 2011, which was recorded for a potential teen-oriented pop album that was never issued. She later disowned the track for its bubblegum pop sound, saying that she had no interest in recording music of that genre. The song was later certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). On a second soundtrack, Victorious 2.0, released on June 5, 2012 as an extended play, Grande supplied vocals as part of the show's cast for the song "5 Fingaz to the Face". The third and final soundtrack, Victorious 3.0, was released on November 6, 2012, featuring Grande duetting with Victoria Justice in the song "L.A. Boyz". A music video of the song followed.

Meanwhile, Nickelodeon created Sam & Cat, an iCarly and Victorious spin-off starring Jennette McCurdy and Grande. Grande and McCurdy reprised their respective roles as Cat Valentine and Sam Puckett on the buddy sitcom, which paired the characters as roommates who form an after-school babysitting business. The pilot aired on June 8, 2013, and the show was immediately picked up by the network.

== Artistry ==


=== Musical style and genres ===
Grande's music is generally pop and R&B with elements of EDM, hip hop, and trap, the latter first appearing prominently on her Christmas & Chill extended play. While consistently maintaining pop-R&B tones, she has increased incorporation of trap into her music as her career has progressed thanks to her work with record producer Tommy Brown. She has worked with Brown on every album and stated that "one of the things I love most about working with Tommy is that none of the beats he plays me ever sound the same." Grande learned how to sound engineer and produce because she loves being hands on during every project, and revealed that Mac Miller thought her how to work with Pro Tools. Justin Tranter, a recent collaborator, felt inspired to see how involved Grande is in her music "from the writing to the vision to the storytelling and to even engineering and comping her own vocals." She has co-written several of her songs addressing a wide variety of themes such as love, sex, wealth, breakups, independence, empowerment, self-love and moving on from the past.Grande's debut album, Yours Truly was complimented for recreating the R&B "vibe and feel of the 90s" with the help of songwriter and producer Babyface. Her follow-up, My Everything, was described as an evolution from her debut record with a new sound exploring EDM and electropop genres. She followed her pop-R&B sound on her third album, Dangerous Woman, which was praised by the Los Angeles Times for adapting to different styles with the reggae-pop "Side to Side", the dance-pop-influenced "Be Alright", and the fusion of guitar and trap in "Sometimes." Her trap-pop sound is heavily featured on her fourth and fifth studio albums, Sweetener and Thank U, Next. Elias Leight of Rolling Stone believes "with her new album Sweetener, she set her sights on conquering trap, savage basslines and jittery swarms of drum programming." She also "embraces the sound of hard-bitten Southern hip-hop" exploring elements of funk music with themes of love and prosperity. Craig Jenkins of Vulture wrote that Grande had changed and approached her style to trap and hip hop, filled with R&B undertones on Thank U, Next, with lyrics about breakups, empowerment, and self-love. Her sixth album, Positions, expands on the R&B and trap-pop sound of Sweetener and Thank U, Next, with topics about sex and romance.


=== Influences ===

Grande grew up listening mainly to urban pop and 1990s music and says that "Over the Rainbow" was one of the first songs she remembers singing because "Wizard Of Oz was always my favorite movie when I was younger." Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston are her biggest vocal influences: "I love Mariah Carey. She is literally my favorite human being on the planet. And of course Whitney [Houston] as well. As far as vocal influences go, Whitney and Mariah pretty much cover it." Alongside Carey and Houston, Grande also stated admired Celine Dion and Madonna. Of Dion, Grande reflects on her childhood by posting videos of herself singing songs from Dion's 1997 album Let's Talk About Love on her social media, while being "a diehard Madonna supporter and I love watching her on stage." She credited Gloria Estefan with inspiring her to pursue a music career, after Estefan complimented a performance she saw Grande give on a cruise ship when she was eight years old. She has cited Fergie as another influence because she is "fun and passionate [and] has a fantastic voice and she can belt Gs and As and she doesn't have to do it all the time." She praised Imogen Heap's "intricate" song structure and named Judy Garland as a childhood influence, admiring the latter's ability to tell "a story when she sings".Musically, Grande admires India.Arie because her "music makes me feel like everything is going to be okay" and loves Brandy's songs because "her riffs are incredibly on point." Destiny's Child and Beyoncé are also major influences and inspirations in her career. She has also expressed admiration for rappers who impact the music industry without a planned release date, telling Billboard, "My dream has always been to be — obviously not a rapper, but, like, to put out music in the way that a rapper does. I feel like there are certain standards that pop women are held to that men aren't. ... It's just like, 'Bruh, I just want to ... drop [music] the way these boys do." It inspired her to release "Thank U, Next" without any prior announcement, which The Ringer believes "is more of a Drake move than an Ariana Grande move."


=== Voice ===
Grande is a light lyric soprano, possessing a four-octave vocal range and a whistle register. With the release of Yours Truly, critics compared Grande to Mariah Carey because of her wide vocal range, sound and musical material. Julianne Escobedo Shepherd of Billboard wrote that both Carey and Grande have "the talent to let their vocals do the talking ... that's not where the similarities end. ... Grande is subverting it with cute, comfortable, and on-trend dresses with a feminine slant." Grande responded to the comparisons, "[I]t's a huge compliment, but when you hear my entire album, you'll see that Mariah's sound is much different than mine." Steven J. Horowitz of Billboard wrote in 2014, "With her sophomore album, the 'Problem' singer no longer resembles [Carey] – and that's okay."Mark Savage commented in BBC News: "Ariana Grande is one of pop's most intriguing and gifted singers. A magnetic performer with unrivalled vocal control". In The New York Times, Jon Pareles wrote that Grande's voice "can be silky, breathy or cutting, swooping through long melismas or jabbing out short R&B phrases; it's always supple and airborne, never forced." Composer and playwright Jason Robert Brown addressed Grande in a 2016 Time magazine article: "[N]o matter how much you are underestimated ... you are going to open your mouth and that unbelievable sound is going to come out. That extraordinary, versatile, limitless instrument that allows you to shut down every objection and every obstacle."

Grande cited Audrey Hepburn as a major style influence in her early years of fame, but began to find emulating Hepburn's style "a little boring" as her career progressed. She also drew inspiration from actresses of the 1950s and 1960s, such as Ann-Margret, Nancy Sinatra and Marilyn Monroe. Grande's modest look early in her career was described as "age appropriate" in comparison to contemporary artists who grew up in the public eye. Jim Farber of New York Daily News wrote in 2014 that Grande received less attention "for how little she wears or how graphically she moves than for how she sings." That year, she abandoned her earlier style and began wearing short skirts and crop tops with knee-high boots in performances and on red carpets. After years of dyeing her hair red for her role as Cat Valentine, Grande wore extensions as her hair recovered from the damage. Anne T. Donahue of MTV News noted that her iconic high ponytail received more attention than her fashion choices.Although Grande drew criticism for allegedly impolite interactions with reporters and fans in 2014, she dismissed these reports as "weird, inaccurate depictions". Rolling Stone wrote: "Some may cry 'diva', but it's also Grande just taking a stand to not allow others to control her image." In July 2015, Grande was seen on surveillance video in a doughnut shop licking doughnuts that were on display and saying "I hate Americans. I hate America. This is disgusting", referring to a tray of doughnuts. She apologized, writing that she is "extremely proud to be an American" and that her comments related to American obesity. She later released a video apology for "behaving poorly". The incident was parodied by The Muppets and featured in Miley Cyrus' Saturday Night Live cover of "My Way", about the regrets of the summer of 2015. Grande poked fun at the incident herself when hosting Saturday Night Live in 2016, saying: "A lot of kid stars end up doing drugs, or in jail, or pregnant, or get caught licking a doughnut they didn't pay for." In 2020, she revealed that she stopped doing interviews for some time due to the fear of her words being misconstrued and being mislabeled a "diva".Grande has a large following on social media. As of October 2020, her YouTube channel has amassed over 40 million subscribers and her music videos have been viewed a total of over seventeen billion times; her Spotify profile has amassed over 45 million followers, ranking her as the second most followed artist and most followed female; her Instagram account has amassed over 200 million followers, ranking her as the second most followed individual and most followed female; her Twitter account has over 75 million followers, making it the tenth most followed account; and her Facebook page has over 40 million followers.

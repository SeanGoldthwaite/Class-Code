1 - The size of the form
	I sized the form to be as small as possible while also giving enough room for all the buttons. Calculators are pocket sized in real life and I wanted to make the application feel similar.
	I went with a horizontal layout because I think it present the postfix notation best. Postfix is read left-to-right and a horizontal layout usually implies that as well.
2 - Size, appearance, and placement of buttons
	The buttons are directly to the right of the inputs, just as the operator would be directly to the right of the operands in postfix. 
	I wanted the buttons to be all the same size for consistency. I chose the specific size of 50x30 because that was the smallest size that could fit the LogaB text.
	I increased the font size of some of the buttons so that the contents would appear as equal in size as possible across all the buttons.
	I changed all the buttons to the "popup" flatstyle because without it, there was a white border around the buttons which conflicted with the dark theme I attempted. 
	The buttons are a different color from the background of the form so they stand out.
3 - Size, appearance, and placement of data entry.
	Ideally for postfix notation the second input would be to the right of the first but that would result in a very wide, but not very tall overall window size. To fix this I stacked them vertically
	The answer TextBox is set to readonly because a user should be able to write in the asnwer box.
	The "FixedSingle" BorderStyle makes it so the text boxes have a thin but noticeable outline instead of the very thick outline the standard "Fixed3D" BorderStyle comes with.
	The text boxes are a different color from the background of the form so they stand out.
4 - Overall Appearance
	The most noticable overall design descision I made ws switching to a dark theme. I chose my color template from this template https://colorhunt.co/palette/167893 
	Everything else I have done for this class has been with the default colors and I wanted to try something different.

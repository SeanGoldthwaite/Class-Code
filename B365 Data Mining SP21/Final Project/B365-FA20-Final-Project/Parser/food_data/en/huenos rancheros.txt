Huevos rancheros (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈweβoz ranˈtʃeɾos], ‘eggs ranch-style’) is a breakfast dish consisting of eggs served in the style of the traditional large mid-morning fare on rural Mexican farms.


== Basic dish ==
The basic dish consists of fried eggs served on lightly fried or charred corn or flour tortillas topped with a salsa fresca made of tomatoes, chili peppers, onion, and cilantro. Common accompaniments include refried beans, Mexican-style rice, and guacamole or slices of avocado, with cilantro as a garnish.


== Variations ==
As the dish spread beyond Mexico, variations using wheat flour tortillas instead of corn, and pureed chili or enchilada sauce instead of tomato-chili salsa fresca, have appeared. Non-Mexican additions such as cheese, sour cream, and lettuce also have become common additions beyond the dish's native range.

"Huevos divorciados" (divorced eggs) are simply two eggs served in the same style as huevos rancheros but with a different sauce for each egg – usually a salsa roja and a salsa verde.Similar dishes are huevos motuleños of Yucatan  and New Mexican enchiladas montadas.Another variation, "huevos ahogados" or drowned eggs, is a traditional Mexican breakfast of eggs poached in a tomato-chile salsa.
